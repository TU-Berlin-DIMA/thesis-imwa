This folder contains the Wikipedia dumps that were used for most development tests and performance comparisons between WikiTrust and the framework.


You can obtain the plain dumps by decompressing either the bzip2 or 7zip dumps. This can be done with ``7z x <dump>.7z``. Note that enough disk space with a factor up to 20 needs to be available.

***Note:*** The warwiki-20170501 dump was removed due to GitHubs restrictions on a file's size. If you cannot obtain the dump from somewhere else, contact me and I'll upload it.
