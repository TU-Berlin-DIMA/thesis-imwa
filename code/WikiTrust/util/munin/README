This is an example -- it needs to be modified for your host.

If you're using munin, you can install this plugin
to track the number of pages in the queue.
The plugin uses the filename to determine part of
the hostname, as in
    wikitrust_de
to identify the 'de' language.  The url is hard-coded
into the script, but you can change this for your own site.
